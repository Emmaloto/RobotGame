## WEB GRAPHIC PROJECTS WITH JAVASCRIPT GRAPHIC LIBRARIES
  Since I really enjoy working with graphics, I created some graphic programs with some JS graphic libraries like P5.js and createJS. I did this to get some more experience with JavaScript in web design as well as web graphics. The programs are described below.
  
  **IMPORTANT**: Most of these webpages needed to load external resources, and these could only be loaded using a web protocol like http, even for local files. Thus, most of these programs will run correctly only in Firefox if they are downloaded and opened. To get a Chrome-working version, you can use the links in each of the program descriptions.

#### RobotGame - P5.js
Can be run at http://hive.sewanee.edu/oluloep0/web-projects/Robo-Click/   

Hello! This is a simple game I built with a friend in JavaScript using P5.js. Paula Perez (ppere143@fiu.edu) designed the robot, and I dealt with the game mechanics. I plan to add 
- A timer
- Robot Multiplication
- More graphics
soon.  Enjoy!


#### Flower Picker - P5.js 
Can be run at http://hive.sewanee.edu/oluloep0/web-projects/Flower_Picker/  

This is a simple GUI with buttons that show flowers corresponding to their labels when clicked. As mentioned, this program will not show up AT ALL if downloaded and run in Chrome, as I linked the resources (photos) locally. It should work fine in Mozilla.
